# twitterScrape
Twitter scraping functionality currently in use for Discovery Capital Management to track capital allocation and public sentiment through twitter scraping. 

Functionality of each jupytr notebook is purposefully kept slightly cryptic since this program is used at a multi billion dollar hedge fun to make 
confidential trades and research. There is also code that is not involved which I was not allowed to involve. For questions on how to use certain programs
or to discuss functionality,
